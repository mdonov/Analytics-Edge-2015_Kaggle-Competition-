# Analytics-Edge-2015_Kaggle-Competition

The Analytics edge course gave me the chance to learn the foundations of different models and how to train and test in R various models such as linear regression, logistic regression, CART, clustering. It also included a Kaggle competition, where more than 2500 students were challenged to develop an analytics model that will help the New York Times understand the features of a blog post that make it popular. The task was to predict the popularity of a set of New York Times blog articles from the time period September 2014-December 2014.
